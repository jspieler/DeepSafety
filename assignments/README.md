## FAQ

1. I am not familiar with Python/PyTorch/MLFlow/...

    No worries, no one is born a master. This course doesn't require an expert level in programming or machine learning, but we expect you to learn enough by yourself by reading documentation or tutorials. Here are some recommendations (If material is behind a paywall, remember that you can order a lot of material through your university library - there is no need to buy everything yourself):
    * Python: 
        - Introduction To Python: https://jspieler.netlify.app/teaching/introduction-to-python
        - Harvard CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python: https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/
    * Machine Learning:
        - Deep Learning - Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
        - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning - Bishop
        - Staford CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/

2. How should I start?

    * Take a deep breath.
    * Install [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) (recommended) or Python 3.11 on your system.
    * Follow the steps 1 to 5 of the quickstart guide in the repository README to create a virtual environment and train your first model.
    * Start with the first assignment.

3. I am familiar with Weights & Biases (or any other tool). Can I use it instead of MLFlow for experiment tracking?

    Of course, you are free to use whatever you prefer. We just provided a basic MLFlow integration to make the start easier for students with little prior experience.

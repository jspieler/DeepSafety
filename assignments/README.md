# Assignments & Final Project
This directory contains the assignments and the description for the final project.

A word on **scope and difficulty**: some basic programming skills are expected as a prerequisite for this course but we do not assume that you are already familiar with all these technologies and tools. Nonetheless, we will not teach those technologies but expect that you can learn enough by yourself by reading documentation or tutorials as needed to perform small changes. Professional developers and data scientists will constantly have to learn new technologies on their own. Incrementally modifying and maintaining existing systems is far more common than developing new things from scratch. Learning new technologies, libraries and tools and troubleshooting problems with documentation, debugging, and sites like Stackoverflow are important skills.

## Grading
Evaluation will be based on the following distribution:

* 20 % weekly assignments
* 80 % final project (code, validation batch and report, see [project description](project.md) for details)

## FAQ

1. I am not familiar with Python/PyTorch/MLFlow/...

    No worries, no one is born a master. This course doesn't require an expert level in programming or machine learning, but we expect you to learn enough by yourself by reading documentation or tutorials. Here are some recommendations (If material is behind a paywall, remember that you can order a lot of material through your university library - there is no need to buy everything yourself):
    * Python: 
        - Introduction To Python: https://jspieler.netlify.app/teaching/introduction-to-python
        - Harvard CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python: https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/
    * Machine Learning:
        - Deep Learning - Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
        - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning - Bishop
        - Staford CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/
    * PyTorch: 
        - https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html
        - https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html
    * MLFlow: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/index.html

2. How should I start?

    * Take a deep breath.
    * Install [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) (recommended) or Python 3.11 on your system.
    * Follow the steps 1 to 5 of the quickstart guide in the repository README to create a virtual environment and train your first model.
    * Start with the first assignment.

3. I am familiar with Weights & Biases (or any other tool). Can I use it instead of MLFlow for experiment tracking?

    Of course, you are free to use whatever you prefer. We just provided a basic MLFlow integration to make the start easier for students with little prior experience.
